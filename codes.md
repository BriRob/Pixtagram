Leah questions(monday):
Does flask read all the way down first and then hop pages? Or does it hop pages once it hits line 32, then comes back to finish the page?

Flask runs everything in init and then when it hits the import lines, it hops and reads everything in those files and then it makes it available to the rest of the init

Do we need to add the parameters in the function (see line 30 in user routes)

YES! We can do this /<id>/<username> to pull multiple.
Example:
@route('/<id>/<username>')
def user(id, username)

Flask Notes:


step 1: Set up a new api file/route depending on what you are doing:
If you are setting up a new file make sure to add boiler plate:
- models
- any forms you might need
- flask imports (blueprint, request, etc.)

Then create a variable for route name as an instance of blueprint:
ex:   -    user_routes = Blueprint('users', __name__)

Then create the route as needed:
Methods allowed = 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'
Routes that require user to be signed in will need a wrapper (@login_required, imported from flask_login)


step 2:
Flask reads the root __init__ file. Here we import a blueprint route (ex: from .api.auth_routes import auth_routes )

step 3: Register the blueprint as part of app. Parameter 1 = file name, param 2 = url_prefix('/api/whatever')
